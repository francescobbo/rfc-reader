# RFC Reader

RFC Reader is an extension for Visual Studio Code that allows you to quickly read RFCs from within the editor.

## Features

This extension adds a command to the command palette that allows you to search for and read RFCs from within the editor.

Open the command palette and type `Open an RFC`. You will be prompted to enter an RFC number. Enter the number and press enter. The RFC will be opened in a new tab.

The RFC content is fetched from the IETF Datatracker in HTML format, with convenient links to sections and other RFCs, that will be opened in new tabs.

**Enjoy!**
